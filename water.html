                Electric vehicles (EVs), run on electricity instead of gasoline which significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. EVs are powered by rechargeable batteries and have no tailpipe emissions like gas powered cars. They can be charged at home or at public charging stations, and are becoming more popular. There are now many models available with different ranges and features, and are great choice for eco-consciousness individuals who want to reduce their carbon footprint. Try purchasing a new or used electric vehicle for your next choice!

                There is a wide variability in the cost of buying an eclectic vehicle. If you buy used, it will probably be cheaper than if bought new like gas powered cars. Either way electric vehicles do tend to more expensive however the cost is offset by the savings on fuel. Charging an electric car is cheaper than fueling one up and this paired with the tax rebates you can receive, the prices can even out after a couple years.

The way the amount is calculated is you will receive $2,917 if the battery capacity is at least 5 kilowatt hours (kWh) and an additional $417 for each kWh over 5 up to the limit stated above. To receive this, it must also have an external charging source and weigh under 14,000 pounds.

                Water heating refers to the process of heating water for various purposes, such as bathing, cooking, or cleaning. It typically involves using a water heater that heats water to a desired temperature before it's used. 
                Reduce water heating costs is easy, and almost anyone can do it at home! Taking shorter showers, insulating your water heater, installing a tankless water heater or a solar water heating system, using energy efficient appliances, and lowering the temperature of your water heater to a more energy-efficient setting are all ways you can reduce water heating costs. Reducing water heating costs can help earth by conserving energy and reducing overall gas emissions. The decrease in energy  will decrease our reliance on fossil fuels which helps to combat climate change.
